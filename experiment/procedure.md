### Procedure
1. STEP 1 — Apparatus transfer sequence  
   - Click trans1 to begin the first transfer animation. Wait for it to finish.  
   - Click trans2, then trans3, then trans4 in sequence; each starts the next short animation.  
   - After the final transfer completes click the on‑screen "Next" to continue.

2. STEP 2 — Prepare mix inputs (interactive checks)  
   - Take sand and cement from the bag using a trowel in the proportion 3:1 by weight to make standard mortar. Note down the total weight of the sample.  
   - Enter cement mass = 200 g and sand mass = 600 g (1:3 ratio).  
   - Calculate water using the formula: water% = (P/4) + 3 (P = consistency). Enter the computed water (grams).  
   - If an input is incorrect, try again. After three incorrect attempts the simulator will display the correct formula and value.  
   - Click the pour to show the pouring animation; wait for it to finish and then click "Next Level".

3. STEP 3 — Filling and compaction (vibration)  
   - Place mould and attach hopper as shown.  
   - Set vibration parameters: duration = 2 min, speed ≈ 1200–1400 vibrations/min.  
   - Start compaction by clicking trans6. When compaction animation ends, click trans8 then trans7 as prompted.  
   - Click "Next Level" to proceed.

4. STEP 4 — Curing setup  
   - Set curing conditions: 24 hours at 27°C ± 2°C, 90% RH (then store submerged thereafter).  
   - Click the simulator control to begin curing and confirm.  
   - Click "Next Level" when the step completes.

5. STEP 5 — Remove, measure, and test cubes  
   - At the selected age (3, 7, or 28 days) remove the cube from water and wipe dry.  
   - Measure the cube side and enter the measured dimension (expected ≈ 70.6 mm).  
   - Select a cube by clicking its icon  to place it in the compression testing machine.  
   - Enter the loading rate: 14 N/mm² per minute and start the test (use the test/start control shown).  
   - Record Pmax (maximum load at failure) shown by the simulator.  
   - Compute compressive strength: σc = Pmax / A. Enter your calculated σc.  
   - After three incorrect calculation attempts the correct formula and the expected result will be displayed.  
   - Click "Next Level" to continue or to test the next cube.

6. STEP 6 — Repeat for other ages  
   - Repeat the measurement and testing sequence for 7‑day and 28‑day samples.  

7. Final — Results and reset  
   - Review the summary screen for computed strengths.
