### Procedure
1. STEP 1 — Apparatus transfer sequence  
   - Click the "Start Transfer" button to begin the first transfer animation. Wait for it to finish (6 seconds).  
   - Click the "Next Transfer" button, then the "Continue Transfer" button, then the "Final Transfer" button in sequence; each starts the next short animation (6 seconds each).  
   - After the final transfer completes, click the on-screen "Next" to continue to Step 2.

2. STEP 2 — Prepare mix inputs (cement and sand)  
   - Take sand and cement from the bag using a trowel in the proportion 3:1 by weight to make standard mortar. Note down the total weight of the sample.  
   - Enter cement mass = 200 g and sand mass = 600 g (1:3 ratio) using the on-screen calculator.  
   - Click "Submit" to validate. If incorrect, try again. After three attempts, the simulator displays the correct values.  
   - Click "Next Step" to proceed to Step 3.

3. STEP 3 — Add water to mix  
   - Calculate water using the formula: water% = (P/4) + 3 (P = consistency). Enter the computed water (grams, expected 90 g) using the calculator.  
   - Click "Submit" to validate and trigger the water-adding animation. Wait for it to finish (9 seconds).  
   - If incorrect, try again. After three attempts, the correct value is displayed.  
   - Click "Next Step" to proceed to Step 4.

4. STEP 4 — Pour mixed mortar in mould (first pour)  
   - Click the "Pour Mortar" button to start the pouring animation. Wait for it to finish.  
   - Click "Next Step" to proceed to Step 5.

5. STEP 5 — Weigh and prepare for compaction  
   - Click the "Weigh Mixture" button to start the weighing animation. Wait for it to finish.  
   - Click "Next Step" to proceed to Step 6.

6. STEP 6 — Compact the mortar mix (first compaction)  
   - Click the "Start Compaction" button to start the compaction animation. Wait for it to finish.  
   - Click "Next Step" to proceed to Step 7.

7. STEP 7 — Pour again  
   - Click the "Pour Again" button to start the second pouring animation. Wait for it to finish.  
   - Click "Next Step" to proceed to Step 8.

8. STEP 8 — Compact again  
   - Click the "Compact Again" button to start the second compaction animation. Wait for it to finish.  
   - Click "Next Step" to proceed to Step 9.

9. STEP 9 — Curing setup  
   - Set curing conditions: 24 hours at 27°C ± 2°C, 90% RH (then store submerged thereafter).  
   - Click the simulator control to begin curing and confirm.  
   - Click "Next Step" when the step completes to proceed to testing.

10. STEP 10 — Remove, measure, and test cubes  
    - At the selected age (3, 7, or 28 days) remove the cube from water and wipe dry.  
    - Measure the cube side and enter the measured dimension (expected ≈ 70.6 mm).  
    - Select a cube by clicking its icon to place it in the compression testing machine.  
    - Enter the loading rate: 14 N/mm² per minute and start the test (use the test/start control shown).  
    - Record Pmax (maximum load at failure) shown by the simulator.  
    - Compute compressive strength: σc = Pmax / A. Enter your calculated σc.  
    - After three incorrect calculation attempts, the correct formula and expected result will be displayed.  
    - Click "Next Level" to continue or to test the next cube.

11. STEP 11 — Repeat for other ages  
    - Repeat the measurement and testing sequence for 7‑day and 28‑day samples.  

12. Final — Results and reset  
    - Review the summary screen for computed strengths.  
    - Click "Posttest" to proceed to the posttest.
