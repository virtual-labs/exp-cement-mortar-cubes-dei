### Introduction

**Compressive strength** is one of the most essential mechanical properties of cement and represents the maximum compressive load that a hardened cementitious material can withstand before failure. Since mortar and concrete are primarily subjected to compressive stresses in structural applications, the compressive strength of cement serves as a direct indicator of its **quality, performance, and suitability for construction**.

This property is of great importance because it ascertains the quality of cement which is quite useful in building structures. With the increase in compressive strength of cement, properties such as **flexural strength, abrasion resistance, durability, and impermeability** also increase. Therefore, by performing the compressive strength test of cement we can determine different characteristics of cement.

### Hydration Chemistry and Strength Development

When cement is mixed with water, a complex series of **hydration reactions** begins. These reactions gradually convert the cement compounds into hardened crystalline and gel-like products. The most significant hydration reactions contributing to strength development are:

**1. Hydration of Tricalcium Silicate (C₃S):**
```
2C₃S + 6H₂O → C₃S₂H₃ (C-S-H gel) + 3Ca(OH)₂ + Heat
```

**2. Hydration of Dicalcium Silicate (C₂S):**
```
2C₂S + 4H₂O → C₃S₂H₃ (C-S-H gel) + Ca(OH)₂ + Heat
```

**Where:**
- **C₃S**: Tricalcium silicate
- **C₂S**: Dicalcium silicate
- **C-S-H**: Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H gel)
- **Ca(OH)₂**: Calcium hydroxide
- **H₂O**: Water

The **C-S-H gel** formed during hydration is the primary strength-giving product. It fills voids, binds particles together, and contributes to the progressive increase in strength. 

**Strength development timeline:**
- **Tricalcium silicate (C₃S)** is responsible for **early strength** (3–7 days)
- **Dicalcium silicate (C₂S)** contributes to **long-term strength** gain (after 28 days)

### Why Mortar Cubes Instead of Pure Cement?

The compressive strength test of cement mortar is **not carried out on plain cement** because due to the high heat of hydration of cement, thermal cracks develop in the sample during setting and hardening. These cracks would give inaccurate and unreliable results. 

The test is therefore performed on **blocks of mortar** composed of cement and sand (typically in a 1:3 cement-to-sand ratio by mass). The sand acts as:
- A filler material that reduces heat generation
- An inert aggregate that prevents thermal cracking
- A standardized medium for consistent testing

### Test Procedure

The **mortar cubes of size 70.6 mm × 70.6 mm × 70.6 mm** are prepared, compacted in specified layers, cured under controlled conditions, and tested under a compression testing machine at the end of:
- **3 days** – Early strength assessment
- **7 days** – Intermediate strength
- **28 days** – Standard strength (used for design purposes)

### Calculation of Compressive Strength

During testing, each cube is subjected to a gradually increasing compressive load in a **Compression Testing Machine (CTM)** until failure. The compressive strength is then calculated using the relation:

```
σc = Pmax / A
```

**Where:**
- **σc** = Compressive strength (N/mm² or MPa)
- **Pmax** = Maximum load applied at failure (in Newtons)
- **A** = Loaded area of the cube (in mm²)

For the standard cube:
```
A = 70.6 mm × 70.6 mm = 4984.36 mm² ≈ 5000 mm²
```

Thus:
```
σc = Pmax / 5000 (N/mm² or MPa)
```

### Significance of Results

The results provide an indication of:
- The cement's ability to withstand compressive loads
- Its rate of strength gain over time
- Its overall performance in structural applications

**Higher compressive strength is generally associated with:**
- Improved durability
- Better abrasion resistance
- Lower impermeability (reduced water penetration)
- Long-term stability in diverse environmental conditions
- Enhanced resistance to chemical attack
